## Joint Reflection on Career Paths and Skills (150 words)

Comparing our Week 1 career research revealed interesting differences in our approaches. While I'm focused on cybersecurity roles at Starling Bank and Deloitte, my partner is more interested in cloud engineering positions at AWS and Microsoft. Despite different career paths, we identified two critical shared skill gaps: lack of industry certifications and limited hands-on experience with security tools.

We agreed that completing CompTIA Security+ would benefit both our goals - it's valuable for security roles and increasingly expected for cloud positions too. My partner suggested I strengthen my CI/CD knowledge since DevSecOps is growing, while I recommended they explore penetration testing basics to understand the attacker perspective.

One strength I admired in my partner was their containerization experience with Docker - something I haven't explored yet. They appreciated my communication skills from my SEN practitioner role, noting that explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders is undervalued but crucial.

This discussion reinforced that while our end goals differ, the foundational skills we're building in this module are universally applicable across tech security roles.
