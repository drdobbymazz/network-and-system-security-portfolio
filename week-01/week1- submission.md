## Skills Gap Analysis

| Skill | Status | Evidence | Development Plan |
|-------|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Strengths** |
| Python, Java, JavaScript | ✅ Strong | TuneHub, financial tracker, Express.js projects | Continue applying to security |
| Problem-solving | ✅ Strong | Discrete maths, debugging, SEN work adaptations | Apply to security contexts |
| Communication | ✅ Strong | SEN role - daily stakeholder communication | Technical communication practice |
| Self-driven learning | ✅ Strong | First-Class Honours, independent projects | Security certifications |
| **Developing** |
| Network protocols | 🟡 Theory | Studied SSL/TLS, IPSec, PGP in module | Home lab implementation |
| Web security | 🟡 Theory | Studied XSS, CSRF, SQLi for exam | DVWA practical exercises |
| Git workflows | 🟡 Basic | Personal use, limited collaboration | Team collaboration practice |
| **Critical Gaps** |
| Security tools | ❌ None | No SIEM, pentest, or vuln scanning experience | **Home lab + HackTheBox** |
| Certifications | ❌ None | No Security+, CEH, or cloud certs | **CompTIA Security+** |
| Cloud platforms | ❌ None | Never used Azure or AWS | **Azure Fundamentals + deploy project** |
| CI/CD | ❌ Theory | Know concepts, never implemented | **GitHub Actions pipeline** |

## Action Plan

### 1. CompTIA Security+ Certification (Priority: High)
**Timeline**: 12 weeks | **Cost**: £430

Study plan: Professor Messer videos + Darril Gibson book, 2 hours/day for 6 weeks, then practice exams until consistently scoring 85%+. Schedule exam for late March 2025.

**Why this matters**: Industry-standard validation of security knowledge. Required/preferred for both security roles. Demonstrates serious commitment beyond coursework.

### 2. Practical Security Tools (Priority: Critical)
**Timeline**: 12 weeks | **Cost**: £30

Set up home lab (Kali Linux, Metasploitable). Learn Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit. Complete 15+ HackTheBox/TryHackMe challenges. Install SIEM (Splunk/ELK) and practice log analysis.

**Why this matters**: Biggest gap for security roles. Can't just know theory - need hands-on demonstration of tool proficiency.

### 3. Cloud Fundamentals - Azure (Priority: Medium)
**Timeline**: 10 weeks | **Cost**: £0-80

Complete Azure Fundamentals learning path. Deploy TuneHub to Azure with proper security (HTTPS, authentication, Key Vault). Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

**Why this matters**: Cloud is baseline expectation now. Addresses both FactSet infrastructure needs and modern security requirements.

## Summary

**Current readiness**: 75% for FactSet (software), 55% for security roles

**After 3 months**: 85% for FactSet, 80% for security roles

**Key insight**: Strong programming and soft skills foundation, but significant gaps in practical security tools, certifications, and cloud platforms. All gaps are addressable through focused self-study. Total investment: ~£460 and 15-20 hours/week.

**Next steps**: Apply to FactSet now (deadline May 2025), begin Security+ study in January, build security portfolio for Starling 2026 intake.
