Key Insights
Market Trends Observed:

Strong demand for Python and cloud technologies (Azure, AWS)
Cybersecurity roles emphasize both technical and communication skills
Graduate programs value practical experience and continuous learning mindset

Personal Realizations:

Current strengths align well with software development roles
Need to develop security-specific certifications and tools knowledge
Communication and documentation skills are crucial across all roles


Reflections
This exercise was valuable for understanding where I stand in the job market. Coming from a CS background with Python, Java, and JavaScript experience, I'm well-positioned for software engineering roles. However, for cybersecurity positions, I need to develop:

Hands-on experience with security tools (SIEM, penetration testing tools)
Industry certifications (Security+, CEH, or vendor-specific)
Stronger networking and incident response knowledge

The most surprising finding was how much companies value soft skills, communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, alongside technical competencies. My SEN practitioner role actually provides relevant experience in communication and working with diverse stakeholders.
Action Items:

Begin CompTIA Security+ certification study (January 2025)
Build personal security lab for hands-on practice
Contribute to open-source security projects on GitHub
Network with security professionals through LinkedIn
